Project: Structural optimization of Lennard-Jones clusters using genetic algorithms 

Main Scientific Domain: 
Molecular dynamics, Monte-Carlo and genetic algorithms
Summary of Project: Global optimization of a non-linear function of n-variables is a 
challenging problem. Finding the absolute extrema of a cost function is a recurring topic in 
a large range of STEM subjects, from chemistry to condensed matter physics, protein 
folding in biology, logistics and planning or determining the neuron weights in deep 
learning artificial neural networks.
One effective way of doing global optimization is by using genetic algorithms (GA). The 
main objective is to implement a generic GA in a way that the n-variables of a cost function 
problem are encoded in “genes”. This algorithm in a nutshell is to “evolve” a population of 
“genes” subject to mutation, mating and the selection of the fittest fraction in a given 
generation.

Goal(s) of the project: 
The key goals of the project are to obtain an understanding of global 
optimization and GA algorithms as global optimization methods. Given that the evaluation 
of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) energy is simple, this cost function is suitable to evaluate the 
performance of the GA developed by the students. The final goal is to demonstrate that the 
implemented GA correctly finds the geometry of a LJ cluster with 13 atoms.

Expected outcomes: The chief deliverable of the project will be a code that can be used to
optimize LJ clusters with an arbitrary number of “atoms”. The students will also have to 
prepare a short written report, and present their results orally.
